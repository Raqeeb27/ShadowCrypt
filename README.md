### *Proactive ransomware defense and secure file hiding for Windows. Effortlessly protect, access, and recover sensitive files using encrypted mappings and smart shortcuts.*

</div>

<br>

## üî¨Original Research

This project is based on the research paper:

### üìÑHiding in the Crowd: Ransomware Protection by Adopting Camouflage and Hiding Strategy With the Link File
* **üìå Authors:** Soohan Lee et al.
* **üìå Published in:** IEEE ACCESS
* **üìå Original Implementation:** [hanXen/ransomware_protect_linker](https://github.com/hanXen/ransomware_protect_linker)
* üîó [Read the Full Paper Here](https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3309879)

<br>

## **‚≠ê Underlying Concept**

This project leverages a key observation about ransomware behavior: it often avoids targeting system files (like `.exe` or `.dll`) and their directories (e.g., `Program Files`, `Windows`). The core idea, inspired by the original work, is to protect valuable data cost-effectively by camouflaging files with system-like extensions and hiding them within system file directories.

To maintain ease of access to these hidden files, this project utilizes Windows shortcut files (also known as link files), providing a seamless way for users to open and manage their protected data.

## üöÄAbout This Improved Project

This project provides an enhanced and more user-friendly implementation of a proactive ransomware defense and secure file hiding solution for Windows. Building upon the foundational concepts, this improved version focuses on simplifying the user experience and expanding the functionality. Key enhancements include:

* **Improved Hiding Functionality:** Now supports hiding multiple selected files simultaneously with a streamlined shortcut creation process.
* **Enhanced Recovery Functionality:** Offers versatile recovery options, allowing users to recover:
    * Multiple selected hidden files.
    * All hidden files by searching the entire system.
    * Hidden files within a specific directory.
    * Hidden files within a specific directory and all its subdirectories (recursive recovery).
* **Right-Click Menu Integration:** Provides convenient right-click menu options for core functionalities, enabling easy access without the need for command-line interaction.
* **Simplified Setup:** Features an easy installation process via a standalone executable (available in the [releases](https://github.com/Raqeeb27/ShadowCrypt/releases)).

This project aims to make robust ransomware defense and secure file management more accessible and efficient for Windows users.

## üõ†Ô∏èPrerequisites

To run this project on your Windows system, ensure the following are installed:

* <img src="images/Readme-Images/Python_Logo.png" alt="Python_Logo" style="width:30px;height:auto; margin-bottom: -3px;">&nbsp;&nbsp; **Python:** Version 3.12 or higher is required. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
* <img src="images/Readme-Images/Powershell_logo.png" alt="Powershell_Logo" style="width:30px;height:auto; margin-bottom: -3px;">&nbsp;&nbsp; **PowerShell:** Windows PowerShell is typically pre-installed on modern Windows systems. Ensure it is enabled and accessible. If needed, you can download the latest version from [here](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases).
* <img src="images/Readme-Images/uv_Logo.png" alt="UV_Logo" style="width:30px;height:auto; margin-bottom: -3px;">&nbsp;&nbsp; **uv:** This package installer is required. You can install it using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install uv
    ```
<br>

**Install Supported Softwares (for broader file format support):**

This project supports secure hiding and recovery of various file formats by leveraging external applications. Installing these applications will ensure a seamless experience with a wider range of files:

* <img src="images/Readme-Images/LibreOffice_Logo.png" alt="LibreOffice_Logo" style="width:30px;height:auto; margin-bottom: -3px;">&nbsp;&nbsp; **LibreOffice:** (for documents, presentations, spreadsheets, PDFs) Download from [here](https://www.libreoffice.org/download/download-libreoffice/).
* <img src="images/Readme-Images/7zip_logo.png" alt="P7zip_Logo" style="width:30px;height:auto; margin-bottom: -3px;">&nbsp;&nbsp; **7-Zip:** (for archive formats) Download from [here](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html).
* <img src="images/Readme-Images/VLC_Logo.png" alt="VLC_Logo" style="width:30px;height:auto; margin-bottom: -3px;">&nbsp;&nbsp; **VLC Media Player:** (for audio and video files) Download from [here](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/).

**Note:** Ensure these applications are installed in their default locations for automatic path detection. You can optionally verify or manually configure the application paths later in the [`app_path.json`](db/app_path.json) file.

<br>

## üìùInstallation

> Before proceeding with the installation, please ensure you have the necessary [prerequisites](#prerequisites) installed.

‚≠ê **Easy Installation via Standalone Executable:** For the simplest installation, you can download and run the latest release of the project. Visit the [release page](https://github.com/Raqeeb27/ShadowCrypt/releases) to download the standalone executable. Running this will guide you through the installation process.‚≠ê

**üî≥Alternatively, you can install from the source code:**

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Raqeeb27/ShadowCrypt.git
    cd ShadowCrypt
    ```

2.  **Build the project and install dependencies:**
    ```powershell
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File install.ps1
    ```
    This script will:
    * Set up the necessary environment and install required dependencies.
    * **Prompt you to create a strong password** that meets minimum security requirements. This password will be used to encrypt the project's internal database. **Please remember this password carefully.**
    * Create executables for easier execution.

3.  **Set up Right-Click Menu Options (Run as Administrator):**
    To enable convenient right-click menu options for easy access to the project's functionalities, run the following batch script as an administrator :
    ```batch
    Set-RightClick.bat
    ```

<br>

## üí°Usage

* Once the installation is complete (either via the standalone executable or from the source code), you can easily interact with the project using the integrated right-click menu options.
* After selecting the desired option, you may encounter User Account Control (UAC) prompts; click "Yes" to proceed.
* A command window will then appear, prompting you to enter the password you set during the installation.

<a name="uninstallation"></a>
## üóëÔ∏èUninstallation

> ‚ö†Ô∏è**Important:** Before proceeding with uninstallation, ensure that you have recovered all your hidden files. The uninstallation process only removes the application and the right-click menu entries and **does not automatically recover your hidden data.**

**If you installed from source:**  
1.  To remove the right-click menu options from your system, run the following batch file as an administrator:  
    ```batch
    Remove-RightClick.bat
    ```  
2.  After running this script, you can manually delete the cloned repository folder if you wish to remove the project files entirely.

**If you installed via the standalone executable:**
1.  Uninstall the application through the Windows Control Panel (Add or Remove Programs or Apps & features, depending on your Windows version).
2.  Upon initiating the uninstallation, your browser will be redirected to an `Uninstall-README.md` file. Read uninstallation guide [here](Uninstall-README.md).
3.  Follow the instructions in the `Uninstall-README.md` file to locate the `Remove-RightClickMenuOptions.bat` file.
4.  **Run the `Remove-RightClickMenuOptions.bat` file as an administrator** to remove the right-click menu options from your system.
5.  After running the batch file, the application files should be fully removed from your system by the uninstaller.
